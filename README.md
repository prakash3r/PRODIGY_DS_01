# World Population Analysis using Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project that analyzes world population data using Python.

## Overview

This project explores global population trends, growth rates, and demographic patterns. It leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and NumPy for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Files

- `population_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis code.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used for analysis (e.g., `population_data.csv`).

## Dependencies

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/world-population-analysis.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:   

```
cd world-population-analysis
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `population_analysis.ipynb` notebook and execute the code cells to run the analysis.

## Results
